Dong Joon Park is a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at the University of Arizona. His research examines how individuals and institutions navigate an evolving higher education landscape and how their decisions and experiences shape career outcomes, mobility, and inequality, particularly among doctorate recipients.
He focuses on topics such as interdisciplinary research training, education–occupation alignment, and diversity initiatives, with special attention to the experiences of women and international scholars. His work draws on nationally representative and large-scale survey data and has been published in _Scientometrics_, with additional articles under review at _Higher Education_, _Social Science Research_, and _Asian Journal of Law and Society_.
Dong Joon has taught undergraduate courses, such as Introduction to Sociology and Social Inequality, and is committed to fostering inclusive, reflective learning environments that support diverse student needs. His long-term goal is to advance sociological understanding of how transformations in academia and labor markets influence equity, opportunity, and professional development.
