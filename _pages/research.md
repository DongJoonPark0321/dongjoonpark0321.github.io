## Research Overview

My research examines how individuals navigate changes in higher education and how these experiences shape career trajectories, rewards, and mobility for doctorate recipients. I focus on topics such as:

- Gender disparities in legal professions following educational reform in South Korea.
- The effects of interdisciplinary research (IDR) on job satisfaction and education–occupation alignment.
- The role of university structures and faculty diversity in shaping graduate training.
- International doctorate recipients’ career decisions across countries and sectors.
- Postdoctoral researchers' work activity and their career.
